## Scenario 1: Parsing RINEX Observation and Navigation File Headers
Given: The script is provided with valid RINEX observation (`algo0010.25o`) and navigation (`brdc0010.25n`) files
When: The script parses the headers of both files
Then: The script should extract all relevant metadata, including version, marker name, receiver information, and satellite system identifiers

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] The script correctly identifies the RINEX version and file type from the header
- [ ] The script extracts marker and receiver information
- [ ] The script identifies all satellite systems present in the files
- [ ] The script handles both observation and navigation file headers

## Scenario 2: Parsing RINEX Data Records
Given: The script has successfully parsed the headers of the RINEX files
When: The script processes the data records in both observation and navigation files
Then: The script should extract all observation epochs and navigation messages without data loss

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All observation epochs are parsed and stored
- [ ] All navigation messages are parsed and stored
- [ ] The script can handle multiple epochs and satellites per epoch
- [ ] The script reports an error if a data record is malformed

## Scenario 3: Extracting Satellite Ephemeris and Observation Data
Given: The script has parsed the RINEX files and stored the data records
When: The script extracts satellite ephemeris from the navigation file and observation data from the observation file
Then: The script should provide access to ephemeris parameters and raw observation values for each satellite

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] The script extracts ephemeris for each satellite present in the navigation file
- [ ] The script extracts observation data (e.g., pseudorange, carrier phase) for each satellite and epoch
- [ ] The script associates observation data with the correct satellite and epoch

## Scenario 4: Computing Pseudoranges for Each Satellite
Given: The script has extracted observation data for all satellites and epochs
When: The script computes pseudoranges for each satellite at each epoch
Then: The script should output the computed pseudoranges, handling any required corrections (e.g., clock bias)

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] The script computes pseudoranges using the correct observation type (e.g., C1, P1)
- [ ] The script applies necessary corrections (e.g., clock bias, ionospheric delay if applicable)
- [ ] The script reports an error if required observation types are missing

## Scenario 5: Calculating the Receiver's Position Solution
Given: The script has computed pseudoranges for all visible satellites at a given epoch
When: The script calculates the receiver's position using the pseudoranges and satellite ephemeris
Then: The script should output the receiver's coordinates (latitude, longitude, height) for each epoch

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] The script uses at least four satellites to compute a position solution
- [ ] The script outputs coordinates in a standard format (e.g., WGS84)
- [ ] The script reports an error if there are insufficient satellites for a solution

## Scenario 6: Handling Mixed Satellite Systems (GPS, GLONASS)
Given: The RINEX files contain data from multiple satellite systems (e.g., GPS, GLONASS)
When: The script processes the observation and navigation data
Then: The script should correctly identify and handle each satellite system, using the appropriate ephemeris and observation types

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] The script distinguishes between GPS and GLONASS satellites
- [ ] The script uses the correct ephemeris format for each system
- [ ] The script can compute positions using satellites from multiple systems if supported

## Scenario 7: Outputting Calculated Coordinates in a Clear, Documented Format
Given: The script has calculated the receiver's position for one or more epochs
When: The script outputs the results
Then: The output should be clear, well-documented, and include epoch time, coordinates, and quality indicators

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] The output includes epoch time, latitude, longitude, and height
- [ ] The output format is documented and easy to interpret
- [ ] The output includes quality indicators (e.g., number of satellites used, solution status)

## Scenario 8: Handling Missing Data
Given: The RINEX files are missing required data (e.g., missing observation types, incomplete ephemeris)
When: The script attempts to process the files
Then: The script should detect the missing data and report a clear, actionable error

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] The script checks for the presence of required observation types and ephemeris
- [ ] The script reports a descriptive error if data is missing
- [ ] The script does not crash or produce invalid results

## Scenario 9: Handling Unsupported Observation Types
Given: The RINEX files contain observation types not supported by the script
When: The script encounters an unsupported observation type during parsing or computation
Then: The script should skip unsupported types and report a warning

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] The script identifies unsupported observation types
- [ ] The script skips unsupported types without failing
- [ ] The script logs a warning or message indicating the unsupported types

## Scenario 10: Handling Malformed Records
Given: The RINEX files contain malformed or corrupted records
When: The script attempts to parse these records
Then: The script should detect the malformed records, skip them, and report an error or warning

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] The script detects malformed records during parsing
- [ ] The script skips malformed records without halting execution
- [ ] The script logs an error or warning for each malformed record
