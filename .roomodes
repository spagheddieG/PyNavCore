Analyze Gherkin Scenarios  \n- Identify key behaviors to test.  \n\n### 2. Set Up Minimal Test Infrastructure  \n- Add mocks, fixtures, and helpers only as needed.\n- Ensure Proper Setup and Isolation: Use minimal dependencies, mocking only components directly impacting the behavior. Keep tests independent with fresh instances of objects or state each time.\n\n### 3. Write Unit Tests with Guard Rails  \n- Focus on observable behavior, not implementation details.\n- Use Dynamic, Flexible Assertions: Base assertions on expected behavior, avoiding hardcoded values. Calculate results dynamically (e.g., using formulas or relative values) rather than assuming fixed outputs.  \n- Avoid over-specification unless critical.  \n- Use dependency injection and interfaces for dependencies.  \n- Use descriptive names ‚Üí `test[Scenario]_[Condition]_[ExpectedResult]`.  \n- Test one behavior per test, avoiding multiple unrelated assertions.  \n- Ensure tests are isolated with no shared state.\n- Handle Asynchronous Behavior: Account for delays or side effects by waiting for async operations to complete (e.g., using waitFor or similar tools) before asserting results.\n- Keep setup minimal and relevant.  \n\n### 4. File Handling  \n- Use `write_to_file` for new test files.  \n- Use `apply_diff` to update existing test files (`.test.(js|tsx|ts)`).  \n\n### 5. Verify Failure  \n- Verify Test Failure for the Right Reason: Ensure tests fail because the functionality isn‚Äôt implemented (e.g., assertion fails), not due to setup errors or unexpected runtime issues (e.g., \"undefined is not a function\"). Define placeholders (e.g., empty functions) if needed to prevent unrelated failures. Run tests using `execute_command` to confirm they fail correctly.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Evaluate Tests with Guard Rails Checklist  \n\n### Scoring System  \nStart at 100 points, deduct for violations:  \n\n#### Maintainability  \n- Tests target behavior (Critical, -30)  \n- No over-specification (Moderate, -15)  \n- Dependencies use interfaces (Moderate, -15)\n- Dynamic assertions used (Moderate, -15)\n\n#### Clarity  \n- Descriptive names (Moderate, -15)  \n- One behavior per test (Moderate, -15)  \n\n#### Isolation  \n- Isolated tests (Critical, -30)  \n- Minimal setup (Minor, -5)\n- Proper async handling (Moderate, -15)\n\n### Reporting  \nProvide a score breakdown for each category and overall (e.g., \"Maintainability: 85\").  \nUse severity indicators:  \n- üü¢ (90-100)  \n- üü° (70-89)  \n- üî¥ (<70)  \n\nList violations with severity and deduction (e.g., \"Over-specification (-15)\").  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Complete the Red Phase  \n- Use `attempt_completion` to finalize the Red phase only when tests fail for the right reasons and meet guardrail standards, reducing the need for back-and-forth revisions.",
